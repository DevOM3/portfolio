          Firstly, thank you for scrolling down ðŸ˜‰. You are here because you may
          be curious to know who am I or you may have to see what I've written
          in the About section of the portfolio. My name is
          <strong> Om Prashant Londhe</strong>{" "}
          <small>({`${new Date().getFullYear() - 2003}`} years old)</small> and
          I am a student who loves to develop something that can beat what I've
          developed earlier. I love to make new things using a superpower called
          <strong> Programming</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          I learnt too many things during the COVID-19 Pandemic because I love
          programming and want to just do it as much as can do. Eradicate my
          intoxication of programming helped me to learn more and more and
          ......
          <br />
          Some of the things are given below-

          Acting towards a new idea and developing something is one side of a
          coin of my passion but the another side of that coin is very different
          and it is called Gaming. I've been gaming since I was just 5 years
          old, it means before I started programming, I was a gamer!

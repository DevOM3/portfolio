          Firstly, thank you for scrolling down ðŸ˜‰. You are here because you may
          be curious to know who am I or you may have to see what I have written
          in the About section of the portfolio. My name is
          <strong> Om Prashant Londhe </strong>
          <small>({new Date().getFullYear() - 2003} years old)</small> and I am
          a student who loves to develop something that can beat what I have
          developed earlier. I love to make new things using a superpower called
          <strong> Programming</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          I learnt too many things during the COVID-19 Pandemic because I love
          programming and want to just do it as much as can do. Eradicate my
          intoxication of programming helped me to learn more and more and
          ......
          <br />
          Some of the things are given below

          Acting towards a new idea and developing something is one side of a
          coin of my passion but the another side of that coin is very different
          and it is called Gaming. I have been gaming since I was just 5 years
          old, it means before I started programming, I was a gamer!
